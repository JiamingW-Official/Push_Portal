# Push — Design System v11

> **Authority**: Single source of truth for every UI surface in the Push project. Layout, color, typography, component shape, motion, spacing — all of it conforms to the tokens below.
>
> **v11 Status (2026-04-25, Editorial Calibration · Grid + Negative Space + Unified Button refinement · Liquid-Glass Expansion + Image-First + 3-Tier Rule Classification, late evening)**: v10's N2W warm-candy foundation is preserved verbatim. v11 layers on a Grain-Archive editorial register so marketing surfaces gain a magazine voice without breaking dashboard / form / product UI. Three fonts unchanged. Page bg, body color, body size, hover-shift signature — unchanged. **Refined across two evening passes:**
>
> **Evening pass 1:** strict 8px grid system with explicit column / gutter / margin tokens; negative-space tokens locked per container type (text-to-edge, text-to-line, text-to-vector); corner-anchored title rules; max-title sizes pushed up (Magvix Hero to clamp(64,9vw,160), Footer Wordmark to clamp(140,18vw,320)); unified button system (5 variants, no exceptions); 3 NEW warm-neutral tokens (`--graphite` `--mist` `--char`) extending the 11-stop warm-gray ladder; closed Allowed-Color List rule (only tokens in this file may appear in production, photos and visual effects exempt); selective `border-radius: 0` allowed for 3 specific editorial moments only.
>
> **Evening pass 2 (this pass):** § 0 **Three-Tier Rule Classification** added (🔒 STRICT / 📐 STRUCTURED / 🎨 OPEN — read first; every rule in this doc carries one of these tags); § 8.9 **Liquid Glass System** expanded from 2 use cases to 6 (Footer Tile Pair / Candy Panel Stat Tile / Hero Photo Stat Peek / Sticky Filter Rail / Photo Card Floating Badge / Scroll Progress Pill); § 8.10 **Image-First Layout Patterns** added (4 patterns: Full-Bleed Hero Photograph / Photo Card with Bottom Gradient Overlay grid / Framed Photo Tile in Candy Panel / Decorative Photo Collage); audit pass — removed v10 leftovers from non-historical sections, confirmed no internal contradictions, all rules now carry tier classification.

## 0. Three-Tier Rule Classification (READ FIRST)

Push's design system is 3 layers stacked. **Every rule in this document carries one of three tags** — read the tag before you decide whether you can deviate.

### 🔒 STRICT — Identity (the bones that make Push recognizable)

Cross-page invariant. Cannot be modified per-page, per-context, or per-mood. Changing a STRICT rule requires a Design.md PR with user (Jiaming) sign-off.

**Examples:** the 11-stop warm-gray ladder color tokens, the 3 fonts and their roles, the 8px atomic grid, the 5 unified button variants, the GA Tri-Color nav structure, the Footer pattern (Editorial Blue panel + Darky Giant Wordmark bottom-left), the page background `#f8f4e8`, body color `#61605c`, the bottom-right hover shift, the editorial-moment palette (Editorial Blue / Pink / GA Orange), the closed Allowed-Color List rule, the 12px font floor.

### 📐 STRUCTURED — Composition (how content arranges)

Has a finite allowed-variant set. Designer picks ONE variant from the set; cannot improvise outside the set. Adding a new variant requires Design.md update.

**Examples:** the modular panel inventory (10 panel types in § 15.1), corner-anchored title placement rules (3 anchor positions), negative-space tokens per container type (every container's text-to-edge / text-to-line / text-to-vector / text-to-text spacing is in § 6 tables), the 12 / 8 / 4 column grid, cell-span vocabulary (12, 6+6, 4+4+4, 3×4, 8+4 — no custom 7+5), the radii scale (`4 / 8 / 10 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 28 / 40 / pill / circle`), the 3 selective `border-radius: 0` exceptions, the liquid-glass tile pattern (where it can peek, how many per panel), the image-card patterns (Photo Card with overlay vs framed photo tile vs decorative collage), the Editorial Table Cinema-Selects layout, the Magvix Italic Signature Divider phrasing library, Mono Eyebrow Parenthetical vs Canonical register split.

### 🎨 OPEN — Voice (editorial judgment within bounds)

Designer can improvise. The bounds are still set by STRICT and STRUCTURED rules above, but within those bounds the designer makes the call.

**Examples:** which photograph to feature in a hero, which Magvix Italic phrasing to use for the divider (`End of campaign · Fin ·` vs `Posted · Scanned · Verified ·` — pick what fits the surrounding panels), which adjective in the eyebrow (`(WHY THIS EXISTS)` vs `(WHAT WE DO)`), which inner-card layout (4+4+4 row vs 6+6 split vs 8+4 hero+sidebar), whether to use the Editorial Pink CTA stamp this page or skip it (≤1 per page max), whether to use the Bright Yellow stat tile, which Magvix Italic inline accent word to highlight in a hero headline, which liquid-glass tile to anchor where (within § 8.9's allowed positions), the order of stories in a Photo Grid panel, the tone (warm / cool) chosen for the Adventure router panel.

### How to read this doc

- Every rule body in this document is preceded by one of: **🔒 STRICT** / **📐 STRUCTURED** / **🎨 OPEN**.
- If a rule has no tag, default it to **STRICT** (this preserves system integrity in ambiguous cases).
- When implementing a new page, work top-down: ① obey all STRICT rules ② pick from STRUCTURED variants ③ improvise within OPEN bounds.
- When auditing an existing page, work bottom-up: ① flag deviations from STRICT first (these must be fixed) ② flag STRUCTURED off-list choices second ③ leave OPEN choices alone unless they break the page's editorial coherence.

## 1. Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Closed Allowed-Color List.** Production CSS may only use color values present as tokens in § 2 of this document. Photos and SVG visual effects (illustrations, decorative gradients on background-image only) are exempt. Any new color requires a documented update to this file before being introduced.
2. **8px grid system, enforced.** Every element snaps to 8px increments — width, height, padding, margin, gap, top, left. Half-grid (4px) allowed only for hairlines and small chip gaps. § 5 defines the full grid + column system.
3. **Negative-space tokens are locked per container type.** § 6 lists every container's exact text-to-edge / text-to-line / text-to-vector / text-to-text spacing. Eyeball spacing is forbidden.
4. **Three fonts, role-locked.** Magvix (Regular + Italic) hero / wordmark / signature divider — max 1 hero block per page. Darky display / heading / numerals / **giant footer wordmark**. CS Genio Mono body / UI / labels / parenthetical eyebrows. Magvix never below 28px.
5. **Corner-anchored titles for editorial moments.** Hero title hugs top-left of hero panel (not centered). Footer giant wordmark hugs bottom-left of footer panel (not centered). Section title inside Editorial Table sits top-left of table panel. Centered titles allowed only inside Ticket Panel and inside Photo Card overlay (where center reads as caption-on-image).
6. **iOS 26 continuous corner — selective use.** Standard radii scale `4 / 8 / 10 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 28 / 40 / pill / circle`. **Selective `border-radius: 0` permitted** for: (a) full-bleed Photo Card Hero (cinematic frame), (b) Editorial Hero Tile billboard, (c) Image-collage card inside a panel. All other surfaces (cards, buttons, inputs, panels, modals) use the radii scale.
7. **Unified button system, 5 variants only.** § 9 spec is the single source. Every button on every page renders identically. No per-page custom buttons.
8. **Bottom-right hover shift** is the Push interaction signature — every clickable element does `translate(1px, 1px)` on hover, `translate(2px, 2px) scale(0.98)` on active press. Forms, static badges, GA nav pills, Ticket Panel grommets, Footer giant wordmark do NOT shift.
9. **Marketing vs Product registers must NOT mix in the same viewport.** Marketing surfaces (Home / Landing / Creator showcase / Merchant case study / About / Pricing / Blog) use v11 editorial layer (Ticket Panel, Magvix Italic Divider, Photo Card with Gradient, Editorial Table, Parenthetical Eyebrow, Corner-anchored title). Product surfaces (Dashboard / Settings / Forms / Onboarding / In-app messaging) keep v10 Candy-Panel + clean component voice.
10. **Light mode only.** Page background `--surface` `#f8f4e8` Ivory Cream — never `#ffffff` except as `--snow` text-on-dark. Body text `--ink-3` `#61605c` warm gray. Headings `--ink` `#0a0a0a`.
11. **12px minimum font floor**, with two documented exceptions: Footer Giant Wordmark up to 320px, Hero Magvix up to 160px.
12. **Responsive is naturally adaptive, not redrawn per breakpoint.** Same composition / same hierarchy across mobile / iPad / desktop — only spacing scale + column count adjust. § 14 lists exact breakpoint behavior per container.

## 2. Color Palette (Closed Allowed-Color List)

These are the only color tokens that may appear in production CSS. Any new color requires a documented update to this file. Photos and SVG visual effects are exempt.

### 2.1 The 11-stop Warm-Gray Ladder (foundation — text, surfaces, dividers, dark UI)

The Push warm-gray ladder runs from pure snow to absolute obsidian, all warm-leaning, all derived from the same hue family. v11 adds 3 new stops (`--graphite`, `--mist`, `--char`) to fill historical gaps in the ladder.

| # | Token | Name | Hex | Role |
|---|-------|------|-----|------|
| 1 | `--snow` | Snow | `#ffffff` | Text on dark surfaces (Editorial Blue, Ink, Char, Obsidian, GA Orange Ticket); never page background |
| 2 | `--surface` | Ivory Cream | `#f8f4e8` | Default page background |
| 3 | `--surface-2` | Pearl Stone | `#f5f3ee` | Nested cards on Ivory page, alternate sections |
| 4 | `--surface-3` | Bone | `#ece9e0` | Button hover, muted block, inactive tab background |
| 5 | **`--mist` (NEW v11)** | Mist | `#d8d4c8` | Card frame border, divider band, hover state on light surface, image card backdrop |
| 6 | `--ink-6` | Ink 6 | `#cfcfcf` | Placeholder text, disabled state, lightest chip fill |
| 7 | `--ink-5` | Ink 5 | `#9a9a9a` | Tertiary metadata, icon-secondary |
| 8 | `--ink-4` | Ink 4 | `#6a6a6a` | Secondary label, metadata |
| 9 | `--ink-3` | Warm Body | `#61605c` | **Body copy** (locked — every paragraph, every caption descender) |
| 10 | **`--char` (NEW v11)** | Char | `#3a3835` | Dark panel alternative to `--ink` (softer, warmer); editorial dark-card background; hover state on Ink panel |
| 11 | **`--graphite` (NEW v11)** | Graphite | `#2c2a26` | Mid-strong heading color (between `--ink` H1 and `--ink-3` body); secondary CTA text on light surface; nav text |
| 12 | `--ink-2` | Ink 2 | `#1f1f1f` | Secondary heading, emphasized body, dark panel surface |
| 13 | `--ink` | Ink | `#0a0a0a` | **Primary text, all headings, icon strokes, default UI ink** |
| 14 | `--obsidian` | Obsidian | `#000000` | Reserved — Darky giant wordmark surface only (footer interior contrast); not a body / heading color |

**Hairlines (subset of gray ladder)**:

| Token | Value | Use |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `--hairline` | `rgba(10, 10, 10, 0.08)` | Standard 1px divider, card border |
| `--hairline-2` | `rgba(10, 10, 10, 0.14)` | Emphasized divider, focused input border |
| `--hairline-dotted` | `repeating-linear-gradient(to right, rgba(10,10,10,0.20) 0 4px, transparent 4px 8px)` | Editorial Table row divider, Ticket Panel perforation edge |

### 2.2 Brand Signatures (3 colors, role-locked)

| Token | Hex | Role | Usage |
|-------|-----|------|-------|
| `--brand-red` | `#c1121f` | **Primary CTA** | Apply, Launch, Reserve, Submit — every primary commitment button, every active tab, brand accent line, logo |
| `--accent-blue` | `#0085ff` | **Secondary CTA** | "Learn more", "Read docs", "View pricing", informational link, chart axis accent |
| `--champagne` | `#bfa170` | **Ceremonial** | Partner tier, premium badge, award moment, ceremonial CTA. Max 3 instances per viewport. |

Brand-Red and Champagne in the same module require a neutral anchor between them. N2W Blue + Brand Red can co-exist in the same viewport (complementary roles), but never both primary buttons in the same row.

#### Brand color tints (derivative tokens, OK to use)

```css
--brand-red-deep: #9b0e19;   --brand-red-tint:  rgba(193,18,31,0.08);   --brand-red-focus: rgba(193,18,31,0.18);
--accent-blue-deep: #0077b5; --accent-blue-tint: rgba(0,133,255,0.10);
--champagne-deep: #9d8256;   --champagne-light:  #e8dcc3;                --champagne-tint:  rgba(191,161,112,0.14);
```

### 2.3 Editorial Moments (3 saturated tokens — page-level punctuation, ≤1 per viewport)

| Token | Hex | Role |
|-------|-----|------|
| `--editorial-blue` | `#1e5fad` | **Footer panel** (only allowed instance per page). Optional: 1 hero billboard per landing page max. Snow text only. |
| `--editorial-pink` | `#e8447d` | Single editorial CTA pill OR share-card stamp per page. Snow text only. |
| `--ga-orange` | `#ff5e2b` | **Ticket Panel fill** + Nav Home pill fill. Snow text on Nav pill, Ink text inside Ticket Panel. |

Derivative tokens (OK to use):

```css
--editorial-blue-deep: #144a8a;   --editorial-blue-tint: rgba(30,95,173,0.10);
--editorial-pink-deep: #c8336a;   --editorial-pink-tint: rgba(232,68,125,0.10);
--ga-orange-deep:      #d94215;   --ga-orange-tint:      rgba(255,94,43,0.12);
```

**Editorial Moment Rules**

- The three may co-exist on one page (Editorial Blue footer + 1 Pink CTA stamp + 1 GA Orange Ticket Panel) but **≤1 saturated editorial moment visible per viewport** at any scroll position.
- GA Tri-Color nav (Orange / Green / Sky) appears in nav chrome on every page and does NOT count as a "moment" because it is global chrome — it lives in a separate visual register from page content.
- Forbidden as section background colors outside their assigned container.

### 2.4 Candy Panel Fills (4 tokens)

| Token | Hex | Role |
|-------|-----|------|
| `--panel-butter` | `#fff2d5` | Primary candy panel fill |
| `--panel-peach` | `#fdbc97` | Secondary panel fill, "Choose your adventure" router tile |
| `--panel-blush` | `#f9ebe4` | Tertiary panel fill, supporting card / testimonial backdrop |
| `--panel-sky` | `#c8e2ff` | Cool-side panel, "Resources" tile / cool counterweight |

Plus accent (NOT a full-panel fill):

| Token | Hex | Role |
|-------|-----|------|
| `--panel-bright-yellow` | `#ffe083` | Hero stat tile and billboard moment only |

**Candy Panel Rules**

- Text on Candy Panel = `--ink` `#0a0a0a` always. Never white.
- Adjacent panels alternate warm (Butter / Peach / Blush) → cool (Sky) → warm.
- Standard Candy Panel radius = `--r-3xl` (28px). Internal tiles step down to `--r-xl` (16px).

### 2.5 GA Tri-Color Nav (3 tokens, NEW v11 — global chrome ONLY)

| Token | Hex | Pill Position | Pairs With |
|-------|-----|---------------|-----------|
| `--ga-orange` | `#ff5e2b` | Home pill (leftmost) | `--snow` text |
| `--ga-green` | `#4ade80` | Active page pill | `--ink` text |
| `--ga-sky` | `#93c5fd` | Last pill (About / Sign in) | `--ink` text |

**These three are nav-only. Forbidden as section bg, button fill, card fill, or any other surface.** They live exclusively inside `<nav>` chrome at the top of every page. CTA buttons elsewhere on the page still use Brand Red / N2W Blue / Editorial Pink — the nav and the CTA system speak different languages on purpose.

### 2.6 Category Colors (6 tokens, preserved)

| Token | Category | Hex |
|-------|----------|-----|
| `--cat-food` | Food & Beverage / Saffron | `#b8624a` |
| `--cat-travel` | Travel & Hospitality / Horizon Blue | `#4a7a8c` |
| `--cat-beauty` | Beauty & Wellness / Dusty Rose | `#b5807f` |
| `--cat-fashion` | Fashion & Apparel / Aubergine | `#5d4a6b` |
| `--cat-fitness` | Fitness & Sports / Sage | `#7a8d6e` |
| `--cat-entertainment` | Entertainment / Wine | `#8b3a4c` |

**Dual-role**: Category colors may serve as (1) listing card / detail page / filter chip backgrounds for that category context, OR (2) Candy-Panel-style full-bleed section fills (rare). **Forbidden in global chrome** (nav, footer, system buttons, status indicators).

### 2.7 Color Discipline Rules

1. **Allowed-Color List is closed.** Production CSS uses only the tokens in §§ 2.1-2.6. Photos and SVG visual effects exempt.
2. **Body / paragraph copy is always `--ink-3` warm gray.** Never colored.
3. **Headings = `--ink` or `--graphite` (mid-strong) or `--char` (display on dark surface).**
4. **Saturated editorial moments ≤1 per viewport.**
5. **GA Tri-Color is nav-only. Categories are content-context only. Brand reds/blues/champagne are CTA-only.** Cross-bleed is forbidden.
6. **Adjacent panels alternate warm/cool tone.**
7. **Champagne ≤3 instances per viewport.**
8. **Pure black `--obsidian` is footer-interior only.** All other "black" UI uses `--ink` (or `--char` / `--graphite` for editorial dark cards).

---

## 3. Typography

### 3.1 Type Scale (v11 — locked, larger hero, vertical rhythm enforced)

Vertical rhythm: every type size uses a line-height that lands on the 8px grid. Display sizes lock to `0.9 / 0.95 / 1.0` line-height; body and small lock to `1.5 / 1.55 / 1.6`. No arbitrary line-heights.

| Element | Font | Size | Weight | Line-Height | Letter-Spacing |
|---------|------|------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Magvix Hero — landing only** (1 per page max) | Magvix Regular | `clamp(64px, 9vw, 160px)` ⬆ | normal | `0.9` | `-0.025em` |
| **Magvix Wordmark / Italic Signature** | Magvix Italic | `clamp(56px, 7vw, 96px)` ⬆ | normal italic | `0.95` | `-0.02em` |
| **Magvix Italic Signature Divider** | Magvix Italic | `clamp(28px, 3vw, 40px)` | normal italic | `1.15` | `-0.005em` |

| **Darky Display Hero — non-Magvix pages** | Darky | `clamp(56px, 8vw, 128px)` ⬆ | 900 | `0.9` | `-0.035em` |
| H1 (page title) | Darky | `clamp(40px, 5vw, 72px)` ⬆ | 800 | `1.0` | `-0.025em` |
| H2 (section title) | Darky | `40px` | 800 | `1.05` | `-0.02em` |
| H3 (sub-section / card title) | Darky | `28px` | 700 | `1.15` | `-0.015em` |
| H4 (card body title) | Darky | `24px` | 700 | `1.25` | `-0.01em` |
| H5 (small block title) | Darky | `20px` | 600 | `1.3` | `-0.005em` |
| **Body (default)** | CS Genio Mono | `18px` | 400 | `1.55` | `0` |
| Body small | CS Genio Mono | `16px` | 400 | `1.5` | `0` |
| Small / Label | CS Genio Mono | `14px` | 500 | `1.45` | `0.01em` |
| Caption (min floor) | CS Genio Mono | `12px` | 500–600 | `1.4` | `0.02em` |
| **Eyebrow Canonical** (Product UI) | CS Genio Mono | `12px` | 700 | `1.3` | `0.12em` UPPERCASE |
| **Eyebrow Parenthetical** (Marketing) — `(LINKS)` `(WHY THIS EXISTS)` | CS Genio Mono | `12px` | 700 | `1.3` | `0.12em` UPPERCASE — parens literal |
| **Editorial Table Header** | CS Genio Mono | `12px` | 700 | `1.3` | `0.12em` UPPERCASE |
| **Editorial Table First Cell** | Darky | `18px` (mobile) / `20px` (desktop) | 700 | `1.4` | `-0.01em` |
| **Editorial Table Body Cell** | CS Genio Mono | `16px` | 400 | `1.5` | `0` |
| **Photo Card Title Overlay** (marketing only) | Darky | `20px` (desktop) / `18px` (mobile) | 700 | `1.25` | `-0.005em` color `--snow` |
| **Photo Card Metadata Overlay** | CS Genio Mono | `12px` | 500 | `1.3` | `0.04em` UPPERCASE color `rgba(255,255,255,0.85)` |
| Numbered Section marker | CS Genio Mono | `14px` | 600 | `1.3` | `0.04em` |
| Stat numeral (large KPI) | Darky | `clamp(40px, 5vw, 72px)` ⬆ | 700 | `1.0` | `-0.02em` |
| Stat caption | CS Genio Mono | `14px` | 500 | `1.4` | `0.02em` |
| **Forbidden** | — | `< 12px` OR `> 160px` (Footer Wordmark exempt to 320px, KPI numeral capped at 72px) | — | — | — |

⬆ = pushed larger in v11

### 3.2 Vertical Rhythm Module

**Baseline = 8px.** All vertical spacing snaps to 8px increments. The closest size-to-rhythm anchors:

| Type | Used line-height in px | Rounds to grid (multiple of 8) |
|------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Body 18px × 1.55 | 27.9px | round to 32px (1 row) |
| Small 14px × 1.45 | 20.3px | round to 24px (3/8 row) |
| H4 24px × 1.25 | 30px | 32px |
| H3 28px × 1.15 | 32.2px | 32px |
| H2 40px × 1.05 | 42px | 48px |
| H1 desktop 72px × 1.0 | 72px | 72px (9 rows) |

Use `margin-bottom` in 8 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 48 / 64 / 80 / 96px steps to seat each block on the rhythm grid. Avoid arbitrary `margin-bottom: 22px`.

### 3.3 Font Faces

| Token | Family | Role |
|-------|--------|------|
| `var(--font-hero)` | Magvix (Regular + Italic) | Hero block, wordmark, signature divider, inline accent |
| `var(--font-display)` | Darky (100-900 weight) | All headings, numerals, **footer giant wordmark** |
| `var(--font-mono)` | CS Genio Mono | Body, UI, labels, captions, parenthetical eyebrow |

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Magvix';
  src: url('/fonts/Magvix-Regular.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-display: swap;
}
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Magvix';
  src: url('/fonts/Magvix-Italic.ttf') format('truetype');
  font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; font-display: swap;
}
/* Darky 100-900 individual weight files + CS Genio Mono — declared in globals.css */
```

### 3.4 Typography Rules

1. **Type sizes are the scale above, period.** Never random Tailwind `text-*` mix. Build a custom Tailwind theme exposing only these tokens.
2. **Line-heights match the scale.** Display 0.85-1.05; headings 1.05-1.3; body 1.5-1.6. Never `1.7` / `2.0`.
3. **One H1 per page. One H2 per panel.** H3/H4 only inside cards or table cells.
4. **Eyebrow always CS Genio Mono 12px 700 uppercase 0.12em.** Parenthetical variant on Marketing surfaces; canonical (no parens) on Product UI. The two registers do not mix in the same viewport.
5. **Magvix is hero-only OR signature-divider-only.** Below 28px Magvix becomes illegible. Allowed surfaces: solid color (Ink / Obsidian / Surface / Snow / Brand Red / Candy Panel / GA Orange Ticket / Editorial Blue). Never on gradient or photo.
6. **Magvix Italic = brand wordmark + signature divider + inline accent.** Magvix Regular = hero block headline. Hero block max 1 per page.
7. **Darky giant footer wordmark = 1 instance per page**, footer-only, ≤320px.
8. **Body paragraph = CS Genio Mono.** Never Darky body.
9. **Display tracking is negative** — Darky -0.025 to -0.045em, Magvix -0.02 to -0.025em. Body and small stay at 0.
10. **Hero title hugs panel top-left**, not centered. (See § 7.1 Corner-Anchored Title Rules.)

### 3.5 Magvix Inline Accent Pattern

A single Magvix Italic word may appear inside a Darky 900 hero headline as `<em>` at `font-size: 1.08em`. Max 1 accent word per headline. Max 1 such headline per panel. Max 3 panels using this pattern per page. Accent word must carry semantic weight.

```css
.mixed-headline em {
  font-family: var(--font-hero);
  font-style: italic;
  font-weight: normal;
  font-size: 1.08em;
  letter-spacing: -0.025em;
  vertical-align: baseline;
}
```

## 4. Shape & Radii

### 4.1 Radii Scale (iOS 26 continuous corner)

| Token | Value | Use |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `--r-xs` | `4px` | Toggles, micro-indicators |
| `--r-sm` | `8px` | **Buttons, badges, status pills, small chips** (locked — every button is 8px) |
| `--r-md` | `10px` | **Inputs, tooltips, standard cards, Ticket Panel container** |
| `--r-lg` | `12px` | Dropdown menus, **icon tiles** (40×40) |
| `--r-xl` | `16px` | Floating liquid-glass tiles, mid panels |
| `--r-2xl` | `20px` | Modals, drawers, sheets, photo containers, inner tiles in Candy Panels |
| `--r-3xl` | `28px` | **Standard Candy Panel** |
| `--r-4xl` | `40px` | **Footer rounded-top** + oversized hero panel |
| `--r-pill` | `50vh` | Pill buttons, **GA Tri-Color nav pills**, filter chips |
| `--r-full` | `50%` | Avatars, circular icon buttons, **Ticket Panel grommet circles** |

### 4.2 Selective `border-radius: 0` (NEW v11)

`border-radius: 0` is permitted in exactly 3 editorial contexts:

1. **Full-bleed Photo Card Hero** — when a Photo Card spans the entire viewport width as the hero of a landing page (cinematic frame). Subordinate Photo Cards in a grid still use `--r-md` (10px).
2. **Editorial Hero Tile billboard** — single 1-per-page hero tile (the OFFTRAIL Pattern 05 move) carries `border-radius: 0` to read as a documentary print.
3. **Image-collage card inside a panel** — when 3-5 small images compose as a tactile collage (vintage media reference: VHS / cassette / telegram), each piece is `border-radius: 0` to read as a found object.

**All other surfaces** — standard cards, buttons, inputs, panels, modals, Candy Panels, Ticket Panel, Photo Card grids, footer — use the radii scale, never 0.

### 4.3 Element-to-Radius Mapping

| Element | Radius |
|---------|--------|
| **Footer panel (rounded-top)** | `--r-4xl` (40px) all corners + `overflow:hidden` parent clip |
| Oversized hero panel | `--r-4xl` (40px) |
| **Standard Candy Panel** | `--r-3xl` (28px) |
| Modal / drawer / sheet | `--r-2xl` (20px) |
| Floating liquid-glass tile | `--r-xl` (16px) |
| **Standard card** | `--r-md` (10px) |
| Image / photo container (in card) | `--r-md` (10px) |
| **Ticket Panel container** | `--r-md` (10px) — with grommets + dashed perforation, see § 8 |
| Pricing plan card | `--r-2xl` (20px) |
| **All buttons (filled / ghost / secondary)** | `--r-sm` (8px) — locked, no exceptions |
| Pill button + GA nav pill + filter chip | `--r-pill` (50vh) |
| **Input / textarea / select** | `--r-sm` (8px) |
| Badge / tier badge / small chip | `--r-sm` (8px) |
| Icon tile (40×40 / 48×48) | `--r-lg` (12px) |
| Avatar / icon circle / Ticket Panel grommet | `--r-full` (50%) |
| **Selective `border-radius: 0`** | Full-bleed Photo Card Hero / Editorial Hero Tile / Image-collage card |

### 4.4 Shape Discipline

- All containers use tokens above.
- Third-party components must override radii to match this scale (not 0, unless they are one of the 3 selective exceptions).
- Category-colored cards share radius with neutral cards — category color never changes radius.

## 5. Grid System (NEW v11 — strict)

### 5.1 The 8px Atomic Grid

Every dimension snaps to 8px increments. Allowed values: `8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160, 176, 192, 208, 224, 240, 256, 320, 384, 480, 640`. Half-grid (4px) allowed only for hairlines and small chip gaps.

```css
:root {
  --grid:        8px;
  --grid-half:   4px;

  /* Spacing scale (multiples of grid) */
  --space-1:   8px;
  --space-2:  16px;
  --space-3:  24px;
  --space-4:  32px;
  --space-5:  40px;
  --space-6:  48px;
  --space-7:  56px;
  --space-8:  64px;
  --space-9:  80px;
  --space-10: 96px;
  --space-11: 128px;
  --space-12: 160px;
  --space-13: 192px;
  --space-14: 240px;
  --space-15: 320px;
}
```

### 5.2 The 12-Column Layout Grid (desktop ≥1024px)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Columns | 12 |
| Gutter | 24px |
| Outer page margin | 64px (left + right) |
| Container max-width | 1140px |
| Column width (calculated) | `(1140 - 11×24) / 12 = ~73px per column` |

Implementation:

```css
.grid-12 {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
  gap: 24px;
  max-width: 1140px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0 64px;
}
```

### 5.3 The 8-Column Layout Grid (iPad 768-1023px)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Columns | 8 |
| Gutter | 20px |
| Outer page margin | 48px |
| Container | `100% - 96px` |

### 5.4 The 4-Column Layout Grid (mobile <768px)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Columns | 4 |
| Gutter | 16px |
| Outer page margin | 24px |
| Container | `100% - 48px` |

### 5.5 Cell-span vocabulary

A panel spans 12 / 8 / 4 columns (full bleed) on desktop / iPad / mobile respectively. A card may span 4-12 columns desktop; common spans:

| Pattern | Desktop span | iPad span | Mobile span |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| Full-bleed panel | 12 | 8 | 4 |
| Two-up split | 6 + 6 | 4 + 4 | 4 + 4 (stacked) |
| Three-up grid | 4 + 4 + 4 | 4 + 4 (third wraps) | 4 (stacked) |
| Four-up grid | 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 | 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 (2 rows) | 4 (stacked) |
| Asymmetric (hero + sidebar) | 8 + 4 | 5 + 3 | 4 (stacked) |
| Sticky right rail (detail page) | 8 main + 4 rail | 8 main + 4 rail (sticky becomes inline at iPad) | 4 stacked |

### 5.6 Grid Discipline

1. **Every element snaps to 8px.** Width, height, padding, margin, gap, top, left, right, bottom — all 8px multiples.
2. **No arbitrary `padding: 22px`** or `margin: 35px`. Round to grid.
3. **Container max-width = 1140px desktop**, never wider on text content.
4. **Cell-span vocabulary above is exhaustive** — no custom 7+5 or 9+3 splits without documented reason.
5. **Adjacent panels respect the alternating warm/cool rule** plus snap their internal grids to the page grid (panels can offset internally using a sub-grid, but the panel boundary aligns to the 8px main grid).

---

## 6. Negative Space Tokens (NEW v11 — locked per container)

Every container type has explicit text-to-edge / text-to-line / text-to-vector / text-to-text spacing. Eyeball spacing is forbidden.

### 6.1 Container Padding (text-to-edge)

The distance from a container's outer edge to its inner content (text or first child).

| Container | Desktop | iPad | Mobile |
|-----------|---------|------|--------|
| Page section vertical padding | 96px (top + bottom) | 80px | 56px |
| Page section horizontal padding | 64px (left + right, if not container-bound) | 48px | 24px |
| Container max-width | 1140px (mx-auto) | n/a (uses page padding) | n/a |
| Standard Candy Panel | 96px (all sides) | 64px | 48px |
| Ticket Panel | `64px 96px` (vertical / horizontal) | `48px 56px` | `32px 24px` |
| Modal / drawer | 48px | 40px | 32px |
| Standard card | 24px | 24px | 20px |
| Hero card (large) | 40px | 32px | 24px |
| Liquid-glass tile (in Candy Panel) | 32px | 24px | 20px |
| Footer panel | 96px (interior) | 80px | 56px |
| Editorial Table panel (with surrounding fill) | `48px 56px` | `40px 40px` | `32px 24px` |
| Photo Card text overlay (gradient bottom) | 24px (bottom + sides) | 20px | 16px |
| Nav bar interior | `16px 32px` (vertical / horizontal) | `12px 24px` | `12px 16px` |

### 6.2 Text-to-Text Spacing (block rhythm)

The vertical distance between successive text blocks.

| Block | After it | Desktop | iPad | Mobile |
|-------|----------|---------|------|--------|
| Eyebrow | → H1 / H2 | 16px | 16px | 16px |
| Hero title (Magvix or Darky Display) | → subtitle | 32px | 24px | 16px |
| Hero title | → CTA cluster | 48px | 40px | 32px |
| H1 | → body | 24px | 24px | 16px |
| H2 | → body | 24px | 24px | 16px |
| H3 | → body | 16px | 16px | 16px |
| H4 | → body | 16px | 16px | 16px |
| Body paragraph | → next body paragraph | 16px | 16px | 16px |
| Body | → CTA cluster | 32px | 24px | 24px |
| Stat numeral | → caption | 16px | 16px | 16px |
| Caption | → next caption | 8px | 8px | 8px |
| Section divider (Magvix Italic) | → next section panel | 64px above + 64px below | 48px each | 32px each |

### 6.3 Text-to-Line / Text-to-Hairline Spacing

| Position | Desktop | iPad | Mobile |
|----------|---------|------|--------|
| Text → 1px hairline below | 24px | 16px | 16px |
| Hairline → next text below | 24px | 16px | 16px |
| Editorial Table header → dotted divider | 24px | 16px | 16px |
| Editorial Table dotted divider → first row | 16px | 16px | 16px |
| Editorial Table row content | `20px 0` (vertical padding inside cell) | `16px 0` | `12px 0` |

### 6.4 Text-to-Vector / Text-to-Icon Spacing

| Pairing | Desktop | iPad | Mobile |
|---------|---------|------|--------|
| Icon (40×40 tile) → adjacent text label | 16px | 16px | 12px |
| Inline icon (24×24) → adjacent text | 12px | 12px | 8px |
| Eyebrow icon (12×12) → eyebrow text | 8px | 8px | 8px |
| CTA button text → trailing arrow icon | 8px | 8px | 8px |
| Avatar (40×40) → adjacent name text | 12px | 12px | 12px |
| Bullet → list item text | 16px | 16px | 12px |

### 6.5 Button-Cluster Spacing

| Position | Desktop | iPad | Mobile |
|----------|---------|------|--------|
| Adjacent buttons in a row (gap) | 16px | 16px | 12px |
| Button → secondary text link below it | 16px | 16px | 12px |
| Button group → next text block | 32px | 24px | 24px |

### 6.6 Card / Tile Spacing

| Position | Desktop | iPad | Mobile |
|----------|---------|------|--------|
| Card grid gap (between cards) | 24px | 20px | 16px |
| Card title → card body | 12px | 12px | 8px |
| Card body → card metadata footer | 16px | 16px | 12px |
| Photo Card (gradient overlay) title → metadata | 8px | 8px | 8px |

### 6.7 Negative Space Discipline

1. **Use the table values directly.** Never eyeball, never approximate.
2. **All values are 8px multiples.** Half-grid (4px) only allowed for hairlines.
3. **If a container is not listed**, default to `--space-3` (24px) padding desktop / `--space-2` (16px) mobile.
4. **Vertical rhythm is maintained** — text-to-text spacing always pairs with the type scale's line-height to land each subsequent block on the 8px grid.

## 7. Corner-Anchored Title Rules (NEW v11)

Editorial composition treats the panel as a stage; the title hugs a corner rather than centering. SaaS billboard composition centers everything — Push v11 is editorial, not SaaS-billboard.

### 7.1 Where titles anchor by container type

| Container | Title placement |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Hero panel (landing page entry) | **Bottom-left** of panel (the title sits 96px from the bottom, 64px from the left edge). Photo / image fills the upper area, title pressed-bottom is the GA "Grain Archive" wordmark composition. |
| Section panel (Adventure / Proof / Resources / Anchor) | **Top-left** of panel (eyebrow + title in upper-left corner; supporting content fills the rest) |
| Standard card | **Top-left** of card content area, after eyebrow |
| Footer panel | **Bottom-left** of footer (Darky Giant Wordmark pressed-bottom-left) |
| Ticket Panel | **Centered** (allowed exception — ticket reads as a stamped notice) |
| Editorial Table | **Top-left** of table panel, above the table |
| Photo Card with Bottom Gradient Overlay | **Bottom-left** of overlay (24px from bottom + left) |
| Modal / drawer | **Top-left** of dialog interior |
| Editorial Hero Tile billboard | Title placement defined by the chosen Pattern 05 variant — see Design.md history v9-v10 patterns |

### 7.2 Anchor offset spec

For a corner-anchored title, the offset from the corner equals the container's text-to-edge value. So a Hero panel with 96px desktop interior padding has its bottom-left title sitting 96px from the bottom and 64px from the left (when section padding is 64px). The title is NOT padded inward beyond the container's interior padding.

### 7.3 Centered title — only allowed inside

- Ticket Panel (Magvix Italic centered)
- Editorial Hero Tile billboard (a documented Pattern 05 variant)
- Modal dialog (when title is a single short prompt)

Everywhere else, default is corner-anchored. If a designer wants centered, they must justify it in the PR description.

### 7.4 Composition example — Landing Hero

## 8. Component Specifications

### 8.1 GA Tri-Color Nav (global chrome — every page)

Sticky top, 32×32 Ink monogram circle (left), 3 pills center, optional CTA right.

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Container | `position: sticky; top: 0; background: rgba(248,244,232,0.85); backdrop-filter: blur(16px); border-bottom: 1px solid var(--hairline); padding: 16px 32px; z-index: 100;` |
| Layout | `display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between; max-width: 1140px; margin: 0 auto;` |
| Monogram (left) | 32×32px circle, `background: var(--ink); color: var(--snow);` Magvix Italic 14px centered glyph (e.g. "P" or "•P•"). `border-radius: var(--r-full);` |
| Pill row (center) | `display: flex; gap: 8px;` |
| Each pill | `padding: 8px 18px; border-radius: var(--r-pill);` CS Genio Mono 14px 600 uppercase 0.04em |

| Wordmark behavior | Static. No hover, no animation. |

### 8.4 Mono Eyebrow with Parenthetical

Marketing surfaces use `(LINKS)` `(CONNECT)` `(WHY THIS EXISTS)` form. Product UI surfaces use canonical `LINKS` `CONNECT` `BILLING` form. Two registers do not mix in the same viewport.

```css
.eyebrow {
  font-family: var(--font-mono);
  font-size: 12px;
  font-weight: 700;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  letter-spacing: 0.12em;
  color: var(--ink-3);
  margin: 0 0 16px;
}
/* Parenthetical: parens are literal text characters in the markup */
```

| Surface | Variant | Color |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Marketing landing / About / Blog / Showcase | Parenthetical `(WHY THIS EXISTS)` | `--ink-3` on light surface, `rgba(255,255,255,0.65)` on dark |
| Footer column headers | Parenthetical `(LINKS)` `(CONNECT)` | `rgba(255,255,255,0.65)` |
| Dashboard / Settings / Forms / Onboarding | Canonical `LINKS` (no parens) | `--ink-3` |
| Editorial Table column headers | Canonical `FILM` `YEAR` `MOOD` `WHY WATCH` | `--ink-3` |

### 8.5 Magvix Italic Signature Divider

Between sections — a typographic breath. Replaces "leave whitespace gap".

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Element | Centered short phrase + middle-dot separators |
| Font | Magvix Italic `clamp(28px, 3vw, 40px)` weight normal line-height 1.15 letter-spacing -0.005em |
| Color | `--ink-3` warm gray (NOT full Ink) |
| Separator | Middle-dot `·` (U+00B7) wrapped in spaces |
| Padding | 64px above + 64px below (desktop), 48px each (iPad), 32px each (mobile) |
| Background | Inherits page surface |
| Max per page | 2 |
| Animation | None |
| Hover | None (not a link) |

**Push-specific phrasings** (use these, don't make up new ones unless they map to a real Push concept):

- `End of campaign · Fin ·`
- `Posted · Scanned · Verified ·`
- `Cut · Print · Wrap ·`
- `End of receipt · Fin ·`
- `Story · Scan · Pay ·`
- `Merchant · Creator · Customer ·`
- `Real · Local · Verified ·`

### 8.6 Editorial Table

Cinema-Selects style for Pricing / Compare / KPI / Stats on Marketing surfaces. Dashboard tables stay on v10 card-grid.

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Title | Darky `clamp(40px, 5vw, 64px)` weight 800 color `--ink` margin-bottom 56px, **top-left of table panel** (not centered) |
| Container | `background: var(--surface-2); border-radius: var(--r-md);` `padding: 48px 56px` desktop / `40px 40px` iPad / `32px 24px` mobile. May also live unboxed on `--surface` Ivory. |
| Header row | CS Genio Mono 12px 700 uppercase 0.12em color `--ink-3` parenthetical form `(FILM)` |
| Header → divider spacing | 24px |
| Header divider | `border-bottom: 1px dotted rgba(10,10,10,0.30);` |
| First column cell | Darky 18px (mobile) / 20px (desktop) weight 700 color `--ink` |
| Other column cells | CS Genio Mono 16px 400 color `--ink-3` |
| Last column ("Why" / "Outcome") | Right-aligned |
| Row divider | `border-bottom: 1px dotted rgba(10,10,10,0.18);` lighter than header divider |
| Row vertical padding | 20px desktop / 16px mobile |
| Mobile (<768px) | Table collapses to vertical stack — each row becomes a card with header labels above values, dotted divider between cards. Last column drops right-alignment. |

### 8.7 Photo Card with Bottom Gradient Overlay

Marketing-only card pattern. Image fills card, bottom 35% black gradient, Darky title + mono metadata on overlay.

| Property | Desktop | iPad | Mobile |
|----------|---------|------|--------|
| Container | `position: relative; overflow: hidden;` | same | same |
| Aspect ratio | `4 / 5` portrait OR `1 / 1` square | same | same |

| Image | `object-fit: cover; width: 100%; height: 100%;` | same | same |
| Gradient overlay | `position: absolute; inset: auto 0 0 0; height: 35%; background: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 0%, rgba(0,0,0,0.78) 100%);` | same | same |
| Text overlay padding | 24px from each edge (left + right + bottom) | 20px | 16px |
| Title | Darky 20px (desktop) / 18px (mobile) weight 700 color `--snow` | 20px | 18px |
| Title → metadata gap | 8px | 8px | 8px |
| Metadata | CS Genio Mono 12px 500 uppercase 0.04em color `rgba(255,255,255,0.85)` | same | same |
| Hover | bottom-right shift `translate(1px, 1px)` (subtle), NO image zoom, NO gradient lift | same | same |

### 8.8 Candy Panel

The Push workhorse panel — full-bleed bento cell with warm tonal saturation, Ink text on top, often hosting a floating liquid-glass tile or inner card grid. **Re-fitted to v11's grid + negative-space + corner-anchored title + Marketing/Product register split + 8px vertical rhythm.** Used heavily in Adventure / Proof / Resources panel slots and as the primary Dashboard card surface.

#### 8.8.1 Container Spec

| Property | Desktop | iPad | Mobile |
|----------|---------|------|--------|
| Background fill | One of `--panel-butter` / `--panel-peach` / `--panel-blush` / `--panel-sky` (see § 2.4) | same | same |
| Border radius | `--r-3xl` (28px) all corners | `--r-3xl` (28px) | `--r-2xl` (20px) on mobile only |
| Interior padding | 96px (all sides) | 64px | 48px |
| Span (column grid) | 12 cols full-bleed OR 6+6 split OR 8+4 hero+sidebar | 8 cols full / 4+4 split | 4 cols full (stacked) |
| Box shadow | `--shadow-1` (subtle lift) | same | none |
| Min-height (recommended) | `~480px` for Hero / Anchor variants, `~320px` for standard | `~400px` / `~280px` | natural content height |
| Tone alternation rule | Adjacent panel must be opposite warm/cool tone | same | same |

#### 8.8.2 Internal Vertical Rhythm (8px-grid locked)

Stack order from top to bottom (omit slots not used; spacing only applies between consecutive slots that ARE used):

```
[ Eyebrow ]                       ← (LINKS) parenthetical (Marketing) OR LINKS canonical (Product)
   ↓ 16px (locked, all breakpoints)
[ Title ]                         ← Darky 36-72px corner-anchored top-left
   ↓ 24px desktop / 24px iPad / 16px mobile
[ Body paragraph(s) ]             ← CS Genio Mono 18px line-height 1.55
   ↓ 32px desktop / 24px iPad / 24px mobile
[ CTA cluster ]                   ← 1-2 buttons from § 9 unified system, gap 16px / 12px mobile
   ↓ 56px desktop / 40px iPad / 32px mobile (only if inner-content slot follows)
[ Optional: Inner card grid OR image card OR liquid-glass tile ]
```

All values come directly from § 6 negative-space tokens. No eyeball spacing.

#### 8.8.3 Title Placement (v11 — corner-anchored)

| Panel role | Title placement | Justification |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Hero panel (landing entry) | **Bottom-left** of panel — title sits 96px from bottom, 64px from left (desktop) | Editorial composition (GA Hero pattern). Photo / illustration fills upper area |
| Section panel (Adventure / Proof / Resources / Anchor) | **Top-left** of panel | Inside upper-left corner, eyebrow + title clustered. Supporting content (cards / tile / image) fills the rest of the panel |
| Product Dashboard card | **Top-left** of card content area, after eyebrow | Same as section panel — Product register uses identical anchor |
| Modal / drawer / sheet (when wrapped in Candy fill) | **Top-left** of dialog interior | Same |
| Centered title | **Forbidden inside Candy Panel.** Centered is reserved for Ticket Panel / Photo Card overlay / Modal short prompts only |

#### 8.8.4 Marketing vs Product Register on Candy Panel

| Element | Marketing surface | Product surface |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Eyebrow form | Parenthetical — `(WHY THIS EXISTS)` `(STEP 03)` | Canonical — `WHY THIS EXISTS` (no parens) |
| Title font (typical) | Darky H2 40px or H1 `clamp(40,5vw,72)px` | Darky H2 40px or H3 28px |
| Magvix Italic inline accent in title | Allowed (≤1 per panel, ≤3 panels per page) | **Forbidden** — Product UI keeps Darky-only |
| Body text color | `--ink-3` warm gray | `--ink-3` warm gray |
| CTA variants allowed | Filled Primary / Filled Secondary / Ghost | Filled Primary / Filled Secondary / Ghost / Pill |
| Image card variant | Photo Card with Bottom Gradient Overlay (see § 8.7) | Plain image tile in `--r-2xl` (20px) frame, no overlay |
| Liquid-glass tile inside | Allowed (see § 8.8.6) | Allowed (see § 8.8.6) |
| Magvix Italic Signature Divider INSIDE | Forbidden — divider sits BETWEEN panels, not inside | Same forbidden |

#### 8.8.5 Inner Card Grid Inside Candy Panel

Common pattern: Adventure router shows 3-4 cards inside a Candy Panel.

| Property | Desktop | iPad | Mobile |
|----------|---------|------|--------|
| Inner card span | 4+4+4 (3-up) OR 3+3+3+3 (4-up) | 4+4 (2 per row) | 4 cols full (stacked) |
| Inner card radius | `--r-xl` (16px) — steps DOWN from panel's 28px | same | same |
| Inner card fill | `rgba(255,255,255,0.55)` semi-translucent OR `--surface-2` Pearl Stone OR matching panel-tint token | same | same |
| Inner card padding | 24px (all sides) | 24px | 20px |
| Grid gap between cards | 24px | 20px | 16px |
| Card title | Darky 24px H4 weight 700 color `--ink` | same | Darky 20px |
| Card body | CS Genio Mono 16px line-height 1.5 | same | same |
| Card hover | bottom-right shift (Push interaction signature) | same | same |

#### 8.8.6 Floating Liquid-Glass Tile Inside Candy Panel

Max 1 floating liquid-glass tile per Candy Panel.

| Property | Desktop | iPad | Mobile |
|----------|---------|------|--------|
| Background | `rgba(255,255,255,0.55)` glass + `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` | same | same |
| Border | `1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.65)` | same | same |
| Border radius | `--r-xl` (16px) | same | same |
| Box shadow | `--shadow-glass` | same | same |
| Padding | 32px | 24px | 20px |
| Position (typical) | `position: absolute; top: 32px; right: 32px;` (peeks from upper-right corner of the panel) OR docked bottom-right | same | inline-flow on mobile, no float |
| Content | Stat numeral (Darky `clamp(40,5vw,72)px` weight 700) + caption (CS Genio Mono 14px 500) OR small badge / status | same | same |
| Numeral → caption gap | 16px | 16px | 16px |
| Hover | bottom-right shift | same | same |

#### 8.8.7 Image Card Inside Candy Panel

Photography on a Candy Panel sits inside its own framed tile — never bleeds to panel edge. The panel color is the framing device; the photograph is the subject.

| Property | Desktop | iPad | Mobile |
|----------|---------|------|--------|
| Image container radius | `--r-2xl` (20px) | same | same |
| Image inset from panel interior padding | 32px (so image edge is 96+32=128px from panel outer edge) | 24px (88px total) | 16px (64px total) |
| Image aspect ratio | 4:5 OR 16:9 OR 3:2 (pick one per panel) | same | same |
| Object-fit | `cover` | same | same |
| Image hover | none (the image is not the click target — the surrounding card or button is) | same | same |
| Marketing variant: Photo Card with Bottom Gradient Overlay | Replaces plain image tile when title needs to overlay (see § 8.7) | same | same |

#### 8.8.8 What's Forbidden Inside a Candy Panel

These v11 elements do NOT live inside a Candy Panel — they are page-level or chrome-level:

- **Ticket Panel** (page-level editorial moment, max 1 per page; lives as its own panel slot, not inside)
- **GA Tri-Color nav pills** (global chrome only)
- **Editorial Pink CTA stamp** (page-level moment ≤1; if a Candy Panel needs a strong CTA, use Filled Primary Brand Red or Filled Secondary N2W Blue)
- **Magvix Italic Signature Divider** (sits BETWEEN panels, never inside)
- **Darky Giant Footer Wordmark** (footer-only)
- **Editorial Hero Tile billboard** (own panel slot, not inside)
- **`border-radius: 0` content** (Candy Panel context demands the 28px rounded container — square content inside reads as a mistake)
- **Category colors as background fill of inner card** (categories are content-context only; inner cards use semi-translucent white or `--surface-2` Pearl Stone)
- **Magvix > 96px inside the panel** (Magvix Hero is page-level hero only; inside a Candy Panel, max Magvix size is the Section Title scale `clamp(40,5vw,72)px`)

#### 8.8.9 Adjacent-Panel Tone Alternation (v11 expanded)

The adjacent warm/cool alternation rule applies to all panels in a page stack, including v11's new editorial panels:

| Panel | Tone | Pairs well next to |
|-------|------|--------------------|
| Candy Butter `#fff2d5` | Warm | Sky / Editorial Table on Pearl Stone / Anchor on Char/Ink |
| Candy Peach `#fdbc97` | Warm (saturated) | Sky / Editorial Table / Anchor / Photo Grid on Surface |
| Candy Blush `#f9ebe4` | Warm (soft) | Sky / Editorial Table / Anchor / Ticket Panel |
| Candy Sky `#c8e2ff` | Cool | Butter / Peach / Blush / Anchor on Char |
| Editorial Table on Surface-2 `#f5f3ee` | Neutral-warm | Butter / Peach / Sky / Anchor |
| Photo Grid on Surface `#f8f4e8` | Neutral-warm | Sky / Anchor / Ticket Panel |
| Ticket Panel `--ga-orange` | Warm (saturated) | Sky / Editorial Table / Surface |
| Anchor panel on `--char` or `--ink` | Dark | Butter / Peach / Blush / Sky / Surface |
| Footer `--editorial-blue` | Cool dark | Anything (it's the page exit) |

Two warm Candy Panels stacked = orange-tinted page. Two Sky Candy Panels stacked = cold page. Both forbidden.

#### 8.8.11 Migration from v10 → v11 (Candy Panel-specific)

For existing Candy Panels in the codebase:

1. **Audit title placement** — re-anchor centered titles to top-left (section panel) or bottom-left (hero panel). Update the inner grid template.
2. **Audit eyebrow form** — Marketing pages: wrap eyebrows in parens `(LINKS)`. Product pages: keep canonical `LINKS`.
3. **Audit padding** — confirm 96px / 64px / 48px desktop / iPad / mobile interior padding (snap to 8px grid).
4. **Audit vertical rhythm** — check eyebrow→title 16px / title→body 24px / body→CTA 32px spacing matches § 6.2.
5. **Audit CTA cluster** — replace any per-page custom buttons with Filled Primary / Filled Secondary / Ghost from § 9.
6. **Audit inner card radius** — inner cards step DOWN to `--r-xl` 16px (not v10's 20px).
7. **Audit liquid-glass tile** — confirm `--r-xl` 16px / `--shadow-glass` / 32-24-20px responsive padding.
8. **Audit adjacent-panel tone** — confirm warm/cool alternation across the page stack with v11's expanded panel types.
9. **Audit image card insets** — confirm photo sits inside `--r-2xl` 20px tile, 32px inset from panel interior padding (not bleeding to edge).
10. **Audit forbidden content** — remove any Ticket Panel / Editorial Pink CTA / Magvix Italic Divider / GA Tri-Color from inside Candy Panels.

### 8.9 Liquid Glass System (📐 STRUCTURED — expanded v11)

Push's "floating glass" surface — semi-translucent white with backdrop blur — is one of the system's most recognizable signatures. v10 used it in 2 places (footer + Candy Panel stat tile). **v11 expands to 6 documented use cases.** Always pair the glass effect with the same shadow + radius + border tokens; pick the use case from the list below.

#### 8.9.1 Universal Liquid-Glass Token Set (🔒 STRICT — modeled on iOS 26 Liquid Glass)

Push's liquid glass replicates the iOS 26 Liquid Glass material on the web. The goals: **volumetric thickness** (the surface has a sense of glass-bezel depth, not flat translucency), **specular light effects** (a subtle highlight suggesting light hitting a curved glass surface from above-left), **restrained brightness** (almost-clear base tint, not milky frosted plastic), and **environmental color pickup** (heavy backdrop-blur + saturate pulls color from beneath without hiding it).

**Concept:** the tile feels like a real piece of curved glass set 1-2mm above the page. Light from above catches the top edge (specular highlight); the bottom edge picks up subtle shadow (depth); the body is mostly transparent with a hint of warm tint; everything underneath blurs and saturates as it would through a real glass.

Every liquid-glass surface across all 6 use cases uses these exact properties — never deviate:

```css
/* ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**The 4 visual layers (from back to front), each with a job:**

| Layer | Property | Visual job |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 1. Backdrop blur + saturate | `backdrop-filter: blur(32px) saturate(180%)` | Refracts the content beneath; pulls up color/contrast like real glass would |
| 2. Base tint | `rgba(255,255,255,0.22)` (light) or `rgba(40,36,32,0.32)` (dark) | Gives the glass *some* materiality without becoming milky/opaque |
| 3. Specular gradient (radial) | Top-left peak `rgba(255,255,255,0.55)` fading to transparent | The light effect — suggests a curved glass surface catching ambient light |
| 4. Bezel shadows (4 layers) | Outer drop + inner top highlight + inner bottom shadow | Volume — the glass has thickness; light comes from above |

**Anti-patterns (forbidden):**

- ❌ `background: rgba(255,255,255,0.55)` flat solid (the old v10 pattern) — reads as milky frosted plastic, not glass
- ❌ Single drop shadow only (no inset highlight/shadow) — flat, no perceived thickness
- ❌ `border: 1px solid` — too heavy; the bezel is visualized via inset shadow, not via border
- ❌ `backdrop-filter: blur(8px)` or less — too crisp; iOS 26 Liquid Glass uses heavy blur (28-36px)
- ❌ Saturate values below 140% — under-saturate makes the glass feel "cold and synthetic"; over 200% reads psychedelic
- ❌ Dark variant with cool gray base (`rgba(60,60,60,...)`) — generic; iOS 26 uses warm-shifted base that picks up environmental color
- ❌ Adding shadow tokens (`--shadow-1/2/3`) on top of the glass spec — the multi-layer shadow IS the glass shadow, do not double-shadow

#### 8.9.2 Use Case 1 — Footer Tile Pair (preserved from v10)

Two liquid-glass tiles peek above the rounded-top edge of the Editorial Blue footer panel — Newsletter (left) + Socials (right). See § 8.3 for footer integration.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Position | `position: absolute; top: -40px;` |
| Width | 360px (Newsletter, left) / 280px (Socials, right) |
| Padding | 24px 32px |
| Mobile (<768px) | Stacks inline above footer, full container width, 24px gap between |
| Surface variant | `.lg-surface--dark` (Editorial Blue is dark) |

#### 8.9.3 Use Case 2 — Candy Panel Stat Tile

One liquid-glass stat tile per Candy Panel, anchored upper-right or lower-right corner. See § 8.8.6 for full integration.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Position | `position: absolute; top: 32px; right: 32px;` (default upper-right) OR `bottom: 32px; right: 32px;` |
| Padding | 32px desktop / 24px iPad / 20px mobile |
| Content | Stat numeral (Darky `clamp(40,5vw,72)px` 700) + caption (CS Genio Mono 14px 500) |
| Mobile (<768px) | Drops out of `position: absolute`, flows inline below body, full-width |
| Surface variant | `.lg-surface` (Candy Panel fills are light) |

#### 8.9.4 Use Case 3 — Hero Photo Stat Peek (NEW v11)

When a Hero panel uses a full-bleed photograph as its background and Magvix Italic title is bottom-left anchored, a liquid-glass tile peeks from the **opposite corner** (typically upper-right) carrying a single key stat or merchant name — adds depth without crowding the corner-anchored title.

| Property | Desktop | iPad | Mobile |
|----------|---------|------|--------|
| Position | `position: absolute; top: 96px; right: 64px;` | `top: 80px; right: 48px;` | hidden (mobile drops the peek; the photo + title carry alone) |
| Width | 280-360px | 240-280px | n/a |
| Padding | 32px | 24px | n/a |
| Content allowed | (1) Single stat numeral + caption (`23 merchants` / `1.4M scans`) OR (2) Single quote + attribution OR (3) Single status badge ("Now serving Williamsburg") | same | n/a |
| Max per Hero panel | 1 (more competes with the bottom-left title) | same | 0 (mobile hides) |
| Surface variant | `.lg-surface` if photo is bright, `.lg-surface--dark` if photo is dark | same | n/a |
| Hover | Bottom-right shift `translate(1px, 1px)` only if interactive (e.g. links to merchant page) | same | n/a |

**Concept**: The peek tile is the editorial "second voice" on a Hero panel. The Magvix Italic title makes the page-level statement; the peek tile gives a single sharp data point that grounds it.

#### 8.9.5 Use Case 4 — Sticky Filter / Sort Rail (NEW v11)

On Photo Grid pages (Archive, Showcase, Search), a horizontal liquid-glass pill rail sticks below the GA Tri-Color nav, carrying filter chips and sort controls. Replaces the v10 "filter bar with solid background" pattern.

| Property | Desktop | iPad | Mobile |
|----------|---------|------|--------|
| Position | `position: sticky; top: 80px;` (sits 16px below the GA nav) | `top: 76px;` | `top: 72px;` |
| Width | Container max 1140px, mx-auto | container 100%-96px | container 100%-48px |
| Padding | 16px 24px | 16px 20px | 12px 16px |
| Border radius | `--r-pill` (50vh) — pill shape, not rectangle | same | same |
| Content | Filter chips (use Pill button variant `.btn-pill` from § 9.5) + optional Sort dropdown right-aligned | same | overflow-x: scroll if too many chips |
| Z-index | 95 (just below GA nav's 100) | same | same |
| Hover on chips | bottom-right shift (chip behavior) | same | same |
| Surface variant | `.lg-surface` (light page bg) | same | same |

**Concept**: The filter rail floats — it doesn't pin to surface, doesn't have full-width chrome. The Photo Grid behind it remains visually primary.

#### 8.9.6 Use Case 5 — Photo Card Floating Badge (NEW v11)

A small liquid-glass badge anchored to a Photo Card (with Bottom Gradient Overlay) carrying tier / category / status / date. Adds metadata without competing with the card's own title overlay.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Position | `position: absolute; top: 16px; right: 16px;` (within Photo Card frame) |
| Padding | 8px 14px |
| Border radius | `--r-pill` (50vh) — pill shape |
| Font | CS Genio Mono 12px 600 uppercase 0.04em |
| Content | Single token — tier name (`Bronze`) OR status (`Sold out`) OR date stamp (`Aug 21`) OR category (`Film`). Max 1 token. |
| Mobile (<768px) | Same — stays inside card frame top-right |
| Surface variant | `.lg-surface--dark` (Photo Card image is photographic, behaves as dark surface — text reads white) |
| Hover | none (badge is decorative, not separately clickable; the entire Photo Card is the click target) |

**Concept**: The badge is editorial garnish. It tells you ONE thing about the card — never two. If you need two pieces of metadata, put both in the bottom-overlay metadata strip and skip the floating badge.

#### 8.9.7 Use Case 6 — Scroll Progress Pill / Anchored Action Pop (NEW v11)

For long-form Marketing pages (article, case study, About): a small liquid-glass pill anchored bottom-right of the viewport that either ① shows scroll progress as a percentage OR ② carries a sticky CTA ("Subscribe" / "Apply now") that pops into view after the user scrolls past the hero.

| Property | Desktop | iPad | Mobile |
|----------|---------|------|--------|
| Position | `position: fixed; bottom: 32px; right: 32px;` | `bottom: 24px; right: 24px;` | `bottom: 16px; right: 16px;` |
| Width | auto (content-sized) | same | same |
| Min-width | 120px | 120px | 100px |
| Padding | 12px 20px | 12px 18px | 10px 16px |
| Border radius | `--r-pill` (50vh) | same | same |
| Font | CS Genio Mono 14px 600 uppercase 0.04em | same | 12px |
| Content | EITHER scroll progress (`23% read`) OR sticky CTA (`Subscribe` / `Apply now`) — choose ONE, not both | same | same |
| Z-index | 90 | same | same |
| Show / hide | Hidden until user scrolls past hero (offset 600px); fades in over 240ms | same | same |
| Surface variant | `.lg-surface` (default light), `.lg-surface--dark` if page bg below hero is dark | same | same |
| Hover | bottom-right shift if it's a CTA; none if scroll progress | same | same |
| Max per page | 1 (scroll progress OR CTA, not both) | same | same |

**Concept**: This is the page's "ambient companion." It hovers in peripheral vision, gives one piece of meta-info or one persistent action, and never demands attention.

#### 8.9.8 Liquid Glass Discipline (🔒 STRICT)

1. **The 6 use cases above are exhaustive.** New use cases require Design.md update.
2. **All 6 use the same `.lg-surface` token set** — never invent a new transparent value, blur radius, or border.
3. **Maximum 3 ANCHORED CHROME liquid-glass surfaces visible per viewport.** Anchored chrome = Footer Tile Pair (2) / Hero Photo Stat Peek / Sticky Filter Rail / Scroll Progress Pill. Per-card decorative Floating Badges (Use Case 5, § 8.9.6) are part of their parent card and are NOT counted toward the 3-cap — a 4-up Photo Card row may carry 4 badges, that's fine. Candy Panel Stat Tiles (§ 8.9.3) are part of their parent panel and also NOT counted toward the 3-cap.
4. **Liquid-glass surface always pairs with `--shadow-glass`**, never `--shadow-1/2/3` (those are for solid surfaces).
5. **`backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` is non-negotiable.** If the browser doesn't support backdrop-filter, fall back to `background: rgba(255,255,255,0.85)` solid (more opaque to compensate for missing blur).
6. **Liquid-glass on a photographic background uses the `--dark` variant.** Don't put light-surface glass over a dark photo — it reads dirty.
7. **Hover behavior depends on whether the surface is interactive.** Static glass (footer tile, photo card badge) does NOT shift; interactive glass (sticky CTA pop, filter chip) DOES shift.
8. **Liquid-glass surfaces do not nest.** A liquid-glass tile cannot contain another liquid-glass tile.
9. **Liquid-glass is forbidden inside Ticket Panel, GA Tri-Color nav, Editorial Hero Tile billboard.** These are flat by design.

#### 8.9.9 Where to Use Each Variant — Decision Map

| Page type | Recommended liquid-glass usage |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| Landing / Home | Footer pair (2) + Hero Photo Peek (1) = 3 max. Optional Scroll Progress Pill if page is long. |
| Archive / Photo Grid | Footer pair (2) + Sticky Filter Rail (1) + per-card Floating Badges (multiple but only 1 per card) |
| Showcase (Creator / Merchant) | Footer pair (2) + Hero Peek (1) + per-card Floating Badge for tier (multiple but 1/card) |
| About | Footer pair (2). Optional Hero Peek if About has a hero photo. |
| Article (long-form) | Footer pair (2) + Scroll Progress Pill OR Sticky CTA (1) |
| Pricing | Footer pair (2) + ONE Candy Panel Stat Tile per pricing tier card |
| Dashboard | Footer pair (2) + per-Candy-Panel Stat Tile (1 per panel) |
| Settings / Forms | Footer pair (2) only |
| Modal / Drawer (transient) | None (modals are themselves elevated surfaces; double-elevation reads cluttered) |

### 8.10 Image-First Layout Patterns (📐 STRUCTURED — NEW v11)

GA's pages are image-led — a Push Marketing surface should match that density. v11 documents 4 image patterns; pick ONE per panel based on the panel's role.

#### 8.10.1 Pattern A — Full-Bleed Hero Photograph

Single photograph spans the entire hero panel; Magvix Italic title is bottom-left anchored on top. Optional liquid-glass Hero Peek (§ 8.9.4) sits upper-right.

| Property | Desktop | iPad | Mobile |
|----------|---------|------|--------|
| Container | Full viewport width, height `clamp(560px, 80vh, 880px)` | `clamp(480px, 70vh, 720px)` | `clamp(400px, 60vh, 560px)` |
| Border radius | **`border-radius: 0`** (one of the 3 documented exceptions in § 4.2) for cinematic frame | OR `--r-2xl` (20px) if rounded variant chosen | `--r-md` (10px) on mobile if rounded variant |
| Image | `object-fit: cover; object-position: center;` | same | same |
| Image overlay tint | `background: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(0,0,0,0.15) 0%, rgba(0,0,0,0.45) 100%);` over the photo (helps title legibility) | same | same |
| Title (Magvix or Darky Display) | Bottom-left, 96px from bottom, 64px from left, color `--snow` | 80/48 | 56/24 |
| Eyebrow above title | `(SECTION 01)` or `(NYC LOCAL)` parenthetical, 16px above title | same | same |
| Liquid-glass Hero Peek | Upper-right (see § 8.9.4) | same | hidden mobile |
| Variant: Sub-hero | Same pattern but `clamp(360px, 50vh, 480px)` height | same | scales |

**When to use**: Page entry, single dominant message, 1 photograph carries the page. **Forbidden inside other panels** — this is hero-only.

#### 8.10.2 Pattern B — Photo Card with Bottom Gradient Overlay (existing § 8.7, expanded usage)

Card grid where each card's photograph fills it, gradient overlay carries title + metadata. See § 8.7 for full spec.

**Grid layouts allowed:**

| Layout | Desktop span | iPad span | Mobile span |
|--------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| 2-up | 6 + 6 | 4 + 4 | 4 (stacked) |
| 3-up | 4 + 4 + 4 | 4 + 4 (third wraps) | 4 (stacked) |
| 4-up | 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 | 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 (2 rows) | 4 (stacked) |
| Asymmetric (1 hero + 2 small) | 8 + 4 (4 split into 2 stacked) | 8 + 4 same | 4 (stacked) |

**When to use**: Archive index, Creator showcase, Merchant case study grid, Campaign archive. Each card's image IS the entry point.

#### 8.10.3 Pattern C — Framed Photo Tile Inside Candy Panel

Photograph sits inside its own `--r-2xl` (20px) frame, inset 32px from the Candy Panel interior padding (so the panel color is the framing device, never the photo). Caption sits as a separate text block beside or below the tile, NOT overlaid. See § 8.8.7 for integration spec.

**When to use**: Proof / Resources panels where the photograph supports a longer text block (testimonial + photo, case study + photo). The text is primary; photo is supportive evidence.

#### 8.10.4 Pattern D — Decorative Photo Collage (NEW v11 — GA About-page reference)

Multiple small photographs (3-7) scattered horizontally near the top of an Anchor / About / Story panel, each `border-radius: 0` (one of the 3 documented exceptions in § 4.2), positioned with deliberate negative space between them. Reads as "found objects on a tabletop" — vintage media reference (record / VHS / cassette / telegram / book).

| Property | Desktop | iPad | Mobile |
|----------|---------|------|--------|
| Container | Full panel width, height `auto` | same | same |
| Number of pieces | 4-7 | 3-5 | 2-3 (the rest hide on mobile) |
| Each piece dimensions | width 80-200px, height 80-180px (varied for organic feel) | scales 70% | scales 50% |
| Border radius | **`border-radius: 0`** (3rd documented exception in § 4.2) | same | same |
| Position | `position: absolute;` with hand-placed `top` / `left` per piece, slight rotation `transform: rotate(-3deg)` to `rotate(4deg)` for organic scatter | same | tighter spacing on iPad/mobile |
| Box shadow | `--shadow-1` (subtle lift to suggest physical objects on a surface) | same | same |
| Min spacing between pieces | 32px desktop / 24px iPad / 16px mobile | same | same |
| Responsive | Pieces rearrange but never overlap; smallest 2-3 hide first on mobile | same | hides smallest |

**When to use**: About page top, story / archive intro, "what we collected this season" type editorial panels. Should appear ≤1 per page.

**Concept**: The collage gives the page a tactile, hand-curated feel — a counterweight to the otherwise grid-locked geometry. It's the editorial system's equivalent of a maker's mark.

#### 8.10.5 Pattern Selection Decision Map

| Panel role | Pattern |
|------------|---------|
| Page hero (entry point) | Pattern A — Full-Bleed Hero Photograph |
| Archive / Showcase / Browse / Search results | Pattern B — Photo Card with Bottom Gradient Overlay grid |
| Proof / Testimonial / Case Study (text-led) | Pattern C — Framed Photo Tile Inside Candy Panel |
| About / Story intro / "What we collected" editorial | Pattern D — Decorative Photo Collage |
| Anchor panel with single hero stat + photo | Pattern A (sub-hero variant) OR Pattern C |
| Inside Ticket Panel | NONE — Ticket Panel is solid GA Orange, no photo content |
| Inside Editorial Table | NONE — table is text-and-numbers |

#### 8.10.6 Image Discipline (🔒 STRICT)

1. **Every image uses one of the 4 patterns above.** Don't invent a new image treatment per page.
2. **`border-radius: 0` for images is allowed only in Pattern A (full-bleed hero) and Pattern D (decorative collage).** All other image surfaces use `--r-md` (10px) or `--r-2xl` (20px) per the radii scale.
3. **Photo content is exempt from the Allowed-Color List** (§ 2.7) — photographic images can carry any color. But CSS-applied colors (overlays, gradients, borders) must come from the token list.
4. **Maximum 1 Pattern A or Pattern D per page.** Pattern B and Pattern C can repeat freely within their grid / panel context.

### 8.11 Custom Scrollbar System (🔒 STRICT — NEW v11)

System default scrollbars (Chromium gray slabs / native macOS overlay) clash with Push's editorial register. Every page replaces them with a refined warm-neutral scrollbar that matches the 11-stop ladder + the bottom-right hover-shift interaction signature.

#### 8.11.1 Concept

The scrollbar is **almost invisible at rest** — `--mist` (`#d8d4c8`) thumb on a transparent track reads as part of the page texture, not chrome. On hover, the thumb darkens to `--ink-4` confirming "this is grabbable." On active drag, it darkens to `--ink-3` (the same warm body-text gray) — the press-feedback hierarchy from § 9.0 applies here too: hover never darkens beyond `--ink-4`; only active drag goes to `--ink-3`.

**Width = 8px (snaps to grid).** Pill-radius (`--r-pill`) thumb. No track styling visible. Dark variant (for modal content over Editorial Blue / Ink / Char) uses translucent white.

#### 8.11.2 Universal Scrollbar Token Set

```css
/* ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Push v11 Custom Scrollbar — Light Variant (default, all surfaces)
   Refined warm-neutral; barely visible at rest; matches button hover hierarchy.

.scrollbar--dark {
  scrollbar-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.25) transparent;

}

/* ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */
.scrollbar--horizontal {
  overflow-x: auto;

}

}
```

#### 8.11.3 Where Each Variant Applies

| Surface | Scrollbar variant |
|---------|-------------------|
| Page-level vertical scroll (default `<html>` / `<body>`) | Light variant (default) |
| Modal / drawer scrolling content (light surface) | Light variant |
| Modal / drawer over Editorial Blue / Ink / Char | `.scrollbar--dark` |
| Sticky Filter Rail (horizontal pill row that overflows) | `.scrollbar--horizontal` (6px height) |
| Sideways photo card strip (Showcase carousel) | `.scrollbar--horizontal` |
| Photo Card with Bottom Gradient Overlay (image surface, never scrolls anyway) | `.scrollbar--hidden` |
| Editorial Table (when overflowing on narrow viewports) | Light variant horizontal |
| Code blocks (long monospace lines) | `.scrollbar--horizontal` |
| Liquid Glass tile interior (Stat Tile / Hero Peek / Footer Tile — short content, rarely scrolls) | `.scrollbar--hidden` (the glass effect breaks if a chrome scrollbar appears inside) |

#### 8.11.4 Scrollbar Discipline (🔒 STRICT)

1. **Never use system-default scrollbars.** Every Push page imports the Universal Scrollbar Token Set (§ 8.11.2) into `globals.css` at boot.
2. **Width is always 8px** (vertical) **or 6px** (horizontal `.scrollbar--horizontal`). Never wider — wide scrollbars compete with content for attention.
3. **Track is always transparent.** No track fill, no track border. The thumb floats over the page color.
4. **Thumb radius is always `--r-pill`.** Never square corners.
5. **Color comes from the 11-stop ladder + white-alpha for dark variant.** No new scrollbar colors.
6. **Hover state DARKENS thumb (mist → ink-4); active state DARKENS further (ink-4 → ink-3).** This is the one place the "hover never darkens" rule (§ 9.0) flips — because the scrollbar isn't a button, it's an indicator. Going from invisible-at-rest to visible-on-hover IS the lightening; the color "darkening" is simply going from invisible-warm-pale to visible-darker-warm.
7. **Cross-browser**: `scrollbar-width` + `scrollbar-color` for Firefox; `::-webkit-scrollbar-*` pseudo-elements for Chromium/Safari/Edge. Both must be present.
8. **macOS native overlay scrollbars** (the ones that auto-hide when not scrolling) are overridden by `::-webkit-scrollbar` styling. This is intentional — Push's scrollbar is a deliberate brand element, not a system afterthought.
9. **No scrollbar inside Liquid Glass tiles** — use `.scrollbar--hidden`. A chrome scrollbar appearing inside a glass tile breaks the iOS 26 glass illusion (real glass doesn't have a scrollbar engraved in it).
10. **Mobile (<768px)**: Most mobile browsers don't render explicit scrollbars (touch-scroll). The CSS still applies for the rare mobile browser that does (Firefox Mobile). No special mobile spec needed.
5. **Image alt text is mandatory** — every `<img>` requires meaningful `alt` attribute. Decorative collage images use `alt=""` (decorative role).
6. **Images respect the 8px grid** — width and height snap to 8px multiples (or natural cover of a grid-aligned container).

---

## 9. Unified Button System (NEW v11 — strict)

**5 button variants. Every button on every page renders identically. No per-page custom buttons. No exceptions without a documented PR justification.**

### 9.0 Hover-vs-Press Direction Rule (🔒 STRICT — read first)

The Push button system follows a single physical metaphor:

- **Default state**: button at rest, base color
- **Hover state** (desktop only): surface RISES toward the user → button feels "more alive" → either color UNCHANGED (when transform shift is doing the work) OR color slightly LIGHTER. **Never darker.**
- **Active / pressed state**: surface PUSHES into the page → button feels "pressed in" → color DARKENS to the `*-deep` token (or filter brightness <1 for nav pills) + transform translate (3px, 3px) + scale(0.98)

**The anti-rule is non-negotiable**: a hover state that DARKENS the button is forbidden. It reads as "disabled" or "already pressed" and breaks the user's spatial intuition. Pressing makes things darker (the press-in moment). Hovering makes things lighter (the lift toward you). If you find yourself writing `.btn:hover { background: var(--*-deep); }` — stop, it goes on `:active`.

Two valid hover approaches:

| Pattern | When to use | Hover changes |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| **Transform-only** (default for all buttons WITH bottom-right shift) | Filled Primary / Filled Secondary / Filled Ink / Ghost / Pill / Editorial Pink — every standard button | `transform: translate(1px, 1px)` only. Color unchanged on hover. |
| **Brightness-only** (used when transform is forbidden) | GA Tri-Color nav pills (`.btn-pill--nav`) — these must NOT shift to preserve flat-chrome reading | `filter: brightness(1.08)` only. No transform. |

Active state always combines: `transform: translate(2px, 2px) scale(0.98)` + the color darkening (or `filter: brightness(0.92)` for nav pills).

### 9.1 Filled Primary

The committed-action button — Apply, Launch, Reserve, Submit, Buy.

```css
.btn-primary {
  background: var(--brand-red);
  color: var(--snow);
  font-family: var(--font-mono);
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: 600;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  letter-spacing: 0.04em;
  padding: 14px 28px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: var(--r-sm); /* 8px */
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: transform 180ms cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1),
              background 180ms ease;
  text-decoration: none;
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 8px;
}

/* Hover: transform shift only — color UNCHANGED. The shift IS the interactivity signal. */
.btn-primary:hover  { transform: translate(1px, 1px); }

/* Active/press: transform deeper + scale + DARKEN to brand-red-deep — the press-in moment */
.btn-primary:active { transform: translate(2px, 2px) scale(0.98); background: var(--brand-red-deep); }

.btn-primary:focus-visible { outline: 4px solid var(--brand-red-focus); outline-offset: 2px; }
.btn-primary:disabled { background: var(--ink-6); color: var(--ink-4); cursor: not-allowed; transform: none; }

/* Mobile sizing */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .btn-primary { padding: 12px 24px; font-size: 14px; }
}
```

### 9.2 Filled Secondary

Informational action — Learn more, Read docs, View pricing, See examples.

```css
.btn-secondary {
  background: var(--accent-blue);
  color: var(--snow);
  /* All other base properties identical to .btn-primary */
}
.btn-secondary:hover  { transform: translate(1px, 1px); }
.btn-secondary:active { transform: translate(2px, 2px) scale(0.98); background: var(--accent-blue-deep); }
```

### 9.3 Filled Ink (Ticket Panel + dark surface CTA)

Used inside Ticket Panel (where Brand Red would clash with GA Orange) and on dark surfaces where Ink fill reads as the press-here moment.

```css
.btn-ink {
  background: var(--ink);
  color: var(--snow);
  /* All other base properties identical to .btn-primary */
}
.btn-ink:hover  { transform: translate(1px, 1px); }
/* Note: Ink is already maximum dark — pressing "darker" is impossible.
   We use --char (slightly lighter warm dark) on press as the only visible color shift moment. */
.btn-ink:active { transform: translate(2px, 2px) scale(0.98); background: var(--char); }
```

### 9.4 Ghost (cancel / dismiss / secondary action)

Outlined, no fill. Lower-stakes pair to Filled Primary in dialog actions.

```css
.btn-ghost {
  background: transparent;
  color: var(--ink);
  border: 1px solid var(--ink);
  font-family: var(--font-mono);
  font-size: 16px;
  font-weight: 600;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  letter-spacing: 0.04em;
  padding: 14px 28px;
  border-radius: var(--r-sm);
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: transform 180ms cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1),
              background 180ms ease;
}
/* Hover: transform shift only. Background stays transparent. */
.btn-ghost:hover  { transform: translate(1px, 1px); }
/* Active: fill with --surface-3 (the press-in feedback) + transform deeper. */
.btn-ghost:active { transform: translate(2px, 2px) scale(0.98); background: var(--surface-3); }
```

### 9.5 Pill (filter chip / status tag / GA nav)

Pill-radius, smaller padding, used for non-primary repeated chips.

```css
.btn-pill {
  background: var(--surface-3);
  color: var(--ink);
  font-family: var(--font-mono);
  font-size: 14px;
  font-weight: 600;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  letter-spacing: 0.04em;
  padding: 8px 18px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: var(--r-pill);
  cursor: pointer;
  transition: transform 180ms cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1),
              background 180ms ease, filter 180ms ease;
}
/* Hover: transform only. Background stays at --surface-3. */
.btn-pill:hover  { transform: translate(1px, 1px); }
/* Active: transform deeper + DARKEN to --mist (the press-in moment). */
.btn-pill:active { transform: translate(2px, 2px) scale(0.98); background: var(--mist); }
/* Selected state (sticky on after click): full ink fill + snow text. */
.btn-pill[aria-pressed="true"] { background: var(--ink); color: var(--snow); }
.btn-pill[aria-pressed="true"]:hover  { transform: translate(1px, 1px); }
.btn-pill[aria-pressed="true"]:active { transform: translate(2px, 2px) scale(0.98); background: var(--char); }

/* ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   GA Tri-Color nav pill variant — flat chrome, no transform shift.
   Hover = filter brightness(1.08) (subtle LIGHTEN, the only feedback
   that fits "this is global chrome, not a content button").
   Active = filter brightness(0.92) (the press-in darken).
   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */
.btn-pill--nav { transition: filter 180ms ease; }
.btn-pill--nav.btn-pill--home   { background: var(--ga-orange); color: var(--snow); }
.btn-pill--nav.btn-pill--active { background: var(--ga-green);  color: var(--ink); }
.btn-pill--nav.btn-pill--last   { background: var(--ga-sky);    color: var(--ink); }
.btn-pill--nav:hover  { transform: none; filter: brightness(1.08); }  /* LIGHTEN, never darken on hover */
.btn-pill--nav:active { transform: none; filter: brightness(0.92); }  /* DARKEN on press — the only press feedback */
```

### 9.6 Editorial Pink (single editorial CTA stamp per page max)

Optional sixth flavor — reserved for ONE per-page editorial CTA stamp. Identical mechanics to Filled Primary, different color.

```css
.btn-editorial {
  background: var(--editorial-pink);
  color: var(--snow);
  /* All other base properties identical to .btn-primary */
}
.btn-editorial:hover  { transform: translate(1px, 1px); }
.btn-editorial:active { transform: translate(2px, 2px) scale(0.98); background: var(--editorial-pink-deep); }
```

### 9.7 Button Discipline

1. **Use the 5 (or 6 with Editorial Pink) variants above. No custom buttons.**
2. **Brand Red = primary commitment; N2W Blue = informational; Ink = on-Ticket-or-dark; Ghost = cancel/dismiss; Pill = chip/filter/nav; Editorial Pink = ≤1 per page.**
3. **Every button gets the bottom-right hover shift** except `.btn-pill--nav` (GA Tri-Color nav) which uses `filter: brightness(1.08)` on hover instead.
4. **🔒 STRICT — Hover NEVER darkens.** Hover either keeps the color identical (relying on transform shift for the interactive signal) OR slightly LIGHTENS via `filter: brightness(1.08)` (when transform is forbidden, e.g. nav pills). Darkening is ONLY for `:active` press state — see § 9.0 for the physical metaphor. A hover-darkens pattern reads as "disabled" or "already pressed" and breaks user spatial intuition.
5. **🔒 STRICT — Active/press always darkens.** Use the matching `--*-deep` token (Filled Primary → `--brand-red-deep`, Filled Secondary → `--accent-blue-deep`, Editorial Pink → `--editorial-pink-deep`) OR `filter: brightness(0.92)` for nav pills. Combined with `transform: translate(2px, 2px) scale(0.98)`.
6. **Buttons live in clusters** — primary + ghost in dialogs; primary alone in hero; pill row in filter bar.
7. **Button cluster spacing** = 16px gap between buttons (desktop + iPad), 12px (mobile). See § 6.5.
8. **Disabled state** = `--ink-6` background, `--ink-4` text, no hover shift, `cursor: not-allowed`.
9. **Focus state** = 4px outer focus ring in the button's brand color at 0.18 opacity.
10. **Mobile tap target** = minimum 44×44 hit area (achieved naturally with the padding above + button content).
11. **Icons inside buttons** — use 16-20px icon, gap 8px before label text.

## 10. Layout & Spacing Tokens (locked)

```css
:root {
  /* Spacing scale (multiples of 8px grid) */
  --space-1:   8px;   --space-9:  80px;
  --space-2:  16px;   --space-10: 96px;
  --space-3:  24px;   --space-11: 128px;
  --space-4:  32px;   --space-12: 160px;
  --space-5:  40px;   --space-13: 192px;
  --space-6:  48px;   --space-14: 240px;
  --space-7:  56px;   --space-15: 320px;
  --space-8:  64px;
}
```

| Surface | Padding |
|---------|---------|
| Page section vertical (panel-to-panel breath) | 96px desktop / 80px iPad / 56px mobile |
| Page section horizontal | 64px desktop / 48px iPad / 24px mobile |
| Container max-width | 1140px |
| Block gap (between text blocks within a panel) | 56px desktop / 40px iPad / 32px mobile |
| Card grid gap | 24px desktop / 20px iPad / 16px mobile |

Section dividers (Magvix Italic) take 64px above + 64px below desktop / 48px each iPad / 32px each mobile.

---

## 11. Elevation & Depth

```css
--shadow-1: 0 1px 2px rgba(10,10,10,0.04), 0 1px 4px rgba(10,10,10,0.04);
--shadow-2: 0 0 0 1px rgba(10,10,10,0.04), 0 4px 8px rgba(10,10,10,0.06), 0 8px 24px rgba(10,10,10,0.04);
--shadow-3: 0 0 0 1px rgba(10,10,10,0.04), 0 8px 16px rgba(10,10,10,0.08), 0 16px 48px rgba(10,10,10,0.06);
--shadow-glass: inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.5), 0 8px 32px rgba(10,10,10,0.08);
```

| Token | Use |
|-------|-----|
| `--shadow-1` | Subtle hover, chip pressed |
| `--shadow-2` | Standard card lift, sticky nav |
| `--shadow-3` | Modal, drawer, sheet |
| `--shadow-glass` | Floating liquid-glass tiles in Candy Panels (paired with `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)`) |

**Flat surfaces (no shadow):**

- Ticket Panel — perforation + grommets do the elevation work conceptually
- GA Tri-Color nav pills — flat saturation reads "this is chrome"
- Darky Giant Footer Wordmark — brand stamp, not interactive
- Editorial Hero Tile billboard — documentary print, not lifted

---

## 12. Motion

- **Library**: GSAP ScrollTrigger + Lenis smooth-scroll.
- **Spring timing**: `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)` on hover / press / panel-enter.
- **Standard durations**: 180ms button hover, 240ms card hover, 320ms modal open, 480ms panel scroll-in fade-up.
- **Reduced motion**: `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` disables all transforms / transitions, falls back to opacity-only fade.

**Static (do NOT animate):**

- Ticket Panel container — appears flat, stays flat
- Magvix Italic Signature Divider — typographic breath, not a moment
- Darky Giant Footer Wordmark — pinned brand stamp
- GA Tri-Color nav pills — color-state only, no transform on hover

---

## 13. Icon System

- **One icon family per page** — Lucide OR Material Symbols. Not both on the same page.
- **Every icon sits in a 40×40px tile** with `--r-lg` (12px) corner. Background: `--surface` / `--surface-2` / `--ink` / `--char`. Naked SVG on a Candy Panel or Ticket Panel is forbidden.
- **Icon size inside tile**: 20-24px. Stroke 1.75-2px (Lucide) or weight 400 (Material Symbols).
- **Icon color** matches surface — `--ink` on light surfaces, `--snow` on dark, never colored.
- **Icon-to-text spacing**: 16px desktop (40×40 tile → text), 12px inline (24×24 → text), 8px eyebrow (12×12 → text). See § 6.4.

---

## 14. Responsive Breakpoints (NEW v11 — natural adaptive)

Same composition / same hierarchy across mobile / iPad / desktop — only spacing scale + column count adjust. No alternate layouts per breakpoint.

| Breakpoint | Width | Grid | Section padding (V) | Section padding (H) | Container | Body | Hero (Magvix) | Footer Wordmark |
|-----------|-------|------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------|------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Mobile** | <768px | 4-column, 16px gutter | 56px | 24px | `100% - 48px` | 18px | clamp pulls to ~64px | clamp pulls to ~140px |
| **iPad** | 768-1023px | 8-column, 20px gutter | 80px | 48px | `100% - 96px` | 18px | clamp pulls to ~96px | clamp pulls to ~200px |
| **Desktop** | 1024-1439px | 12-column, 24px gutter | 96px | 64px | 1140px max, mx-auto | 18px | up to 144px | up to 280px |
| **Wide** | ≥1440px | 12-column, 24px gutter | 96px | 64px | 1140px (caps) | 18px | up to 160px | up to 320px |

**Component-specific responsive notes:**

- **GA Tri-Color Nav**: Mobile collapses to monogram + hamburger, opens full-screen overlay with stacked pills.
- **Ticket Panel**: Aspect shifts ~5:2 (desktop) → ~4:3 (iPad) → ~1:1 (mobile). Padding `64px 96px` → `48px 56px` → `32px 24px`.
- **Editorial Table**: Mobile collapses to vertical card stack — each row becomes a card with header labels above values.
- **Photo Card**: Aspect locked at 4:5 OR 1:1 across all breakpoints. Text overlay padding 24px → 20px → 16px.
- **Footer**: 3-column grid → 2-column iPad → 1-column mobile stacked.
- **Magvix Italic Signature Divider**: Padding 64+64px → 48+48px → 32+32px above/below.
- **Hero corner-anchored title**: Offset stays equal to the section padding (96/80/56px from bottom + 64/48/24px from left).

**Touch targets**: All interactive elements ≥ 44×44 hit area on mobile (achieved naturally via § 9 button padding).

---

## 15. Modular Panel Discipline

Marketing pages compose as 3-5 stacked panels, alternating warm/cool tone.

### 15.1 Panel inventory (v11)

| Panel Type | Surface | Use |
|------------|---------|-----|
| **Hero** | Magvix headline corner-anchored on Surface, OR Darky Display on Ink, OR Magvix on Brand Red + image | Page entry |
| **Adventure** (router) | Candy Panel Peach or Butter, multiple inner cards | "Choose your adventure" |
| **Proof** | Candy Panel Blush or Surface-2, testimonial / merchant case + Photo Card | Social proof |
| **Resources** | Candy Panel Sky, link grid + thumbnails | Content / docs |
| **Anchor** | Ink or Char dark panel, large numeral KPI + Magvix Italic accent + dark photo | Single big stat moment |
| **Image** | Full-bleed photo in `--r-md` container, no overlay | Pure visual moment |
| **Editorial Table** | Surface-2 Pearl Stone, Darky title top-left + dotted-line table | "Look at the numbers" |
| **Photo Grid** | Surface, 2-3 col Photo Card with Bottom Gradient Overlay | Showcase grid |
| **Ticket** | GA Orange Ticket Panel | Newsletter / waitlist / single-stamp CTA |
| **Footer** | Editorial Blue rounded-top + Darky Giant Wordmark bottom-left | Page exit |

### 15.2 Composition Rules

- **3-5 panels per page.** Less = unfinished. More = scroll fatigue.
- **Adjacent panels alternate warm/cool tone.**
- **Each panel hosts ≤1 floating liquid-glass tile and ≤1 image card.**
- **Each panel hosts ≤1 saturated editorial moment.**
- **Magvix Italic Signature Divider may sit between any 2 adjacent panels** as a typographic breath. Max 2 dividers per page.
- **Hero title corner-anchored bottom-left** (Magvix or Darky Display); section titles corner-anchored top-left.

### 15.3 Push Marketing Page Default Stack

```
1. NAV (GA Tri-Color, sticky)
2. HERO panel — Magvix Italic accent in Darky 900 hero on Surface, title bottom-left corner-anchored
3. ADVENTURE panel — Candy Peach, "Choose your adventure" 3-card row, title top-left
   ─── divider: Posted · Scanned · Verified · ───
4. PROOF panel — Candy Blush, merchant case study + Photo Card grid
5. EDITORIAL TABLE panel — Surface-2, "Why Push beats Yelp / Groupon" table, title top-left
   ─── divider: End of receipt · Fin · ───
6. TICKET panel — GA Orange, "Tune into the signal" newsletter, headline centered (allowed exception)
7. FOOTER — Editorial Blue rounded-top + Darky Giant "PUSH" bottom-left
```

---

## 16. Hover Behavior — Bottom-Right Shift (Push interaction signature)

```css
.btn, .card, .pill, .clickable {
  transition: transform 180ms cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1);
}
.btn:hover  { transform: translate(1px, 1px); }
.btn:active { transform: translate(2px, 2px) scale(0.98); }
```

### Gets the shift

- All buttons (5 unified variants)
- All cards (campaign card, photo card, content card, listing card)
- Icon buttons, icon tiles
- Pills (status chip, filter chip)
- Ticket Panel CTA button

### Does NOT shift

- Footer giant wordmark (brand stamp)
- Ticket Panel grommets / perforation (decorative)
- GA Tri-Color nav pills (color-state only)
- Magvix Italic Signature Divider (typographic breath)
- Static badges, static eyebrows, body text

## 19. Authority & Conflict Resolution

- This document supersedes Design.md v10 and earlier as the styling authority.
- v10 N2W-calibrated tokens are preserved verbatim where unchanged — listed in "What did NOT change" at top.
- v11 additions (Grid + Negative Space + Unified Button + 3 neutrals + Closed Allowed-Color List + Corner-Anchored Title + Selective `border-radius:0`) are clearly marked `(NEW v11)`.
- Conflicts between v10 history (preserved if archived) and v11 resolve to v11.
- Deviations from v11 require user sign-off (Jiaming) AND a doc update in the same PR introducing the deviation.

> **Last calibrated**: 2026-04-25 evening (Editorial Calibration — Grid + Negative Space + Unified Button refinement applied to v10 N2W foundation)
> **Next planned review**: After Williamsburg Tier 0 pilot launches (2026-05-23) — usability data from real merchants and creators may surface tightening or relaxation needs.
